Tool that every programmer in the world **must have** called _git_ because it will make our development process more easy and manageable.

Rather than copying file in the same folder with changed the name such as `index.html`, `index-final.html`, and so on.

You actually just need this tool to do it even more.

## What's Git?
it's distributed version control system developed by Linus Torvalds and Junio C Hamano, the initial release was on 7th April 2015. Available for Linux, MacOs, and Windows.
