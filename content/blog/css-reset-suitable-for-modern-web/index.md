Tried to download and using CSS reset library out there? sometimes those
things didn't fulfill what you want to produce.

I know what you feel, same with me few years ago I used CSS reset library
such as minireset.css

For me with this CSS reset, I think for you who develope a kind of website 
that has fullpage layout you didn't need to rewrite your styling over your CSS file.

_Just wanna tell you the differences between them and my own, haha._
