# Personal Website
Repository of my personal website powered by github page, and using static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). I intended to create this website because I wanna keep my journey as software engineer as well and as my first reference if I got stuck with programming stuff.

# Future Changes
[x] Light as the main theme
[ ] Adding dark theme and toggle
[ ] Well-structured
